## New website for icon sets {#new-icon-sets-website}

Icon sets section of the website has been completely rewritten.

The new version is based on the Svelte version of [upcoming Iconify Icon Finder](https://github.com/iconify/icon-finder), with an addition of server side rendering.

The same code base is shared with new [Iconify for Figma plug-in](https://github.com/iconify/iconify-figma) and [Iconify for Sketch plug-in](https://github.com/iconify/iconify-sketch) and can be used to create custom icon finder.
