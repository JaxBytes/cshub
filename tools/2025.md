# Iconify Updates 2025


## Iconify API update `[news-time] 12 Feb` {#api-311}

Iconify API version 3.1.1 has been released.

This update includes a critical bug fix. If you are running an API instance, please do update it as soon as possible.

API is available on:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/iconify/api/) - you can customise it before deploying.
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@iconify/api) - can be embedded in an app without running a full server.
- [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/iconify/api) - for quick deployment.

See [API documentation](/docs/api/index.md).


## Iconify plugin for Tailwind CSS 4 `[news-time] 7 Feb` {#iconify-tailwind4}

Iconify plugin for Tailwind CSS 4 is now available.

This plugin can be used with new `[prop]@plugin` directive in Tailwind CSS 4:

```css
@plugin "@iconify/tailwind4";
```

See [plugin documentation](/docs/usage/css/tailwind/tailwind4/index.md) for details.


## Iconify components update `[news-time] 4 Jan` {#components-storage}

New minor versions of all [Iconify icon components](/docs/icon-components/index.md) have been published.

This affects only components that load icon data on demand from Iconify API.

This update removes usage of `[prop]localStorage` for caching icons, making all components GDPR compliant.

### Why was it removed?

Caching icons in storage was a very useful strategy in early days of project, when API was not stable
and there were no offline solutions.

Today there are other solutions, like [various CSS solutions](/docs/usage/css/index.md) and [Unplugin Icons](/docs/usage/svg/unplugin/index.md).

Iconify Icon components load icons from API should only be used when internet access is guaranteed.
Those components should not be used for apps that can work offline.
For offline usage, see links above to alternative solutions.

Additionally, all Iconify icon components have redundancies to load icons from a backup API in case
main Iconify API host is unreachable. Therefore, additional layer of caching is no longer needed.

### Code changes

Code that managed `[prop]localStorage` cache was not just disabled, it was removed.

This reduces package size for components by about 10%.

Functions `[func]enableStorage` and `[func]disableStorage` are still available to avoid breaking user's code,
but they do not do anything.
They will be removed in new major versions of components.
