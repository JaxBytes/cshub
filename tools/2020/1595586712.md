## New documentation is available {#new-documentation}

New documentation is available! [Click here to visit new documentation](/docs/index.md).

Old documentation was badly outdated and almost useless. New documentation has built to be easy to edit and update.

While old documentation was focused on the SVG framework, new documentation covers all topics. New topics can be easily added.
All documents are written in Markdown with a bit of custom syntax.
It covers topics about various components, Iconify API, documentation for developers, tutorials on converting icons, and many other topics.

Many parts of the documentation are under construction. However, it already contains much more information than old documentation did. Documentation is updated almost daily.

New documentation is available on [Iconify GitHub repository](https://github.com/iconify/documentation). Instructions for building documentation are available in `[file]README.md` file. Anyone can contribute.
