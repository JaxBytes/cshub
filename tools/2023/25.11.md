## Iconify for Tailwind update {#tailwind-scale}

A new version of Iconify for Tailwind has been published.

Big change is the option to scale icons and the ability to completely remove icon dimensions.

By setting option `[prop]scale` to `[num]0`, you can remove default dimensions and use custom icon size:

```js
addDynamicIconSelectors({
	scale: 0
});
```

```html
<span class="h-6 w-6 icon-[mdi-light--forum]"></span>
```

See [Iconify plugin documentation](/docs/usage/css/tailwind/options.md).
