## Iconify Tools 3.0 {#tools3}

Iconify Tools version 3.0 is now available.

Changes:
- Several functions are no longer asynchronous: [`[func]cleanupSVG()`](/docs/libraries/tools/icon/cleanup.md), [`[func]runSVGO()`](/docs/libraries/tools/icon/svgo.md).
- New synchronous versions of many functions are available, including [`[func]importDirectory()`](/docs/libraries/tools/import/directory.md).
- Option to keep titles in imported icons.

The main purpose of these changes is to allow using Iconify Tools to import and parse icons in environments where async operations are not supported, such as configuration files of various tools.
