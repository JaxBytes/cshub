## Icon search improvements {#api-302}

Icon search engine in [Iconify API](/docs/api/index.md) has been massively improved.

The new version shows results relevant to the search query first, making it easier to find icons you want.

New search is automatically available for anyone using API, so it is available at [Iconify website](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/), [plugins for Figma/Sketch](/docs/design/index.md) and [Icones](https://icones.js.org).
