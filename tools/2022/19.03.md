## SVG Framework and icon components updated {#version-220}

SVG framework and icon components have been updated!

This release is mostly internal changes, which do not affect functionality:

-   Support for ancient browsers, such as the Internet Explorer, has been dropped.
-   Many packages have switched to [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for unit testing and [Unbuild](https://github.com/unjs/unbuild) for building code.
-   Fixed bug that caused `[func]loadIcon()` to not reject `[class]Promise` instance when icon was not found.
