## Customise speed of animated SVGs {#icon-sets-animations}

[Iconify icon sets](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/) website has been updated.

You can now change the animation speed of animated SVGs.

It is not a full editor (yet), you can only multiply animation duration values to slow down animations or speed them up.

You can use it with any animated icon, such as icons from:
- [Material Line Icons](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/line-md/)
- [Meteocons](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/meteocons/)
- [SVG Spinners](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/svg-spinners/)
