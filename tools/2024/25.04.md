## Figma plugin preview {#figma-preview-ready}

Preview of the new Iconify plugin for Figma is now fully functional.

All functions and pages are working properly.

You can [download and install plugin from GitHub repository](https://github.com/iconify/iconify-figma).

Additionally, the previous version of plugin has been backed up in [archive/v3-dist](https://github.com/iconify/iconify-figma/tree/archive/v3-dist)
branch of repository, so you can use the old version after the new version goes live.
