## Iconify Icon 2.0.0 {#icon-200}

Iconify Icon web component version 2.0.0 has been published.

See [Iconify Icon 2.0.0 beta announcement](/news/2024.html#icon-200b1)
that was published earlier for the list of changes.

### Deprecation of old packages

Time has come to deprecate some old packages, which are no longer relevant:

These old icon components are no longer updated, their source code has been archived:

- [Vue 2](/docs/icon-components/vue2/index.md) (Vue 3 was released a long time ago, no point in supporting the old version)
- [Ember](/docs/icon-components/ember/index.md) (Ember framework is outdated)
- [SVG Framework](/docs/icon-components/svg-framework/index.md) (the oldest of components, has been replaced by the IconifyIcon web component)

You can still use them in your old projects, but should consider updating to modern alternatives, such as web component.
