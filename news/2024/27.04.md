## Iconify for React rewrite {#react-500b1}

Iconify icon component for React has been rewritten.

New version is published as `[str]5.0.0-beta.1`. You can install it by installing `@iconify/react@next`.

Changes:
- Rewritten using modern functional React. Old component still used classes.
- Fixed TypeScript errors.
- Added `[prop]ssr` property, similar to the recent Vue component update. 

### SSR prop

New property `[prop]ssr`, if enabled, will make icon render immediately, without flickering if icon data is available.

```jsx
<Icon icon="mdi:home" ssr={true} />
```

#### Why is it not enabled by default?

Rendering dynamically loaded content is tricky with SSR.
When a page is hydrated, content rendered on server and client must match.
To avoid issues, Iconify icon components do not render anything until the component is mounted, which happens after hydration is complete.

#### When to use it?

The new attribute will render icon immediately when data is available, regardless of mount state.

This should be used carefully with SSR (server side rendering, such as Next).
Make sure icon data is available on server and client before rendering a component.

If you are not using SSR, it is safe to use attribute to force icon render faster because there is no hydration process.
It will render icon immediately when icon data is available.

Or, to be completely safe, use [Iconify Icon web component](/docs/iconify-icon/). It is safe to use with and without SSR.
