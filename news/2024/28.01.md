## New website for browsing icons {#icon-sets-website}

After many months of hard work, [Iconify icon sets website](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/) has been fully rebuilt.

New icon sets website is now live. It is now powered by Nuxt!

What is new?
- Advanced filters for icon sets.
- Infinite smart scrolling for icons, showing as many icons as can fit in your browser window.
- Better code samples for icons in various formats.
- You can customise all colors in icons. If an icon has semi-transparent elements, you can customise opacity.
- Dark/light mode, which is useful when browsing icons with hardcoded colors.

### Infinite smart scrolling for icons

When browsing any icon set or searching for icons, icons take all available browser space. To show more or less
icons, all you have to do is resize your browser window.

You no longer need to click pagination to see more icons, all you have to do is scroll. However, pagination
is still available if you, for example, want to quickly go to the last page.

### Icon hints

When browsing search results, icon have useful hints, showing icon size and icon set license.

License is not shown when browsing an icon set, it is available above icons in icon set information.

### Advanced search

You can now filter icon sets by license, grid, palette.

If you filter icon sets, search has an option to search icons only in icon sets that are visible.

#### Iconify icon components

Old website showed samples for Iconify icon components, new website focuses on full components that you can add
to your applications without extra dependencies.

While Iconify icon components are very convenient, they load icon data from API, which costs a lot of money to run,
which currently [GitHub sponsorships](/sponsors/index.md) do not cover. Not even close.
Therefore, it is better to encourage use of alternative solutions that do not rely on API.

Additionally, if you customise icon, such as change opacity or hardcoded color, Iconify icon components do not
have code to do that on demand.

Code samples for Iconify icon components are also still available.

#### Customise colors and opacity

You can now have more options for customising icon code:
- You can change any color in any icon, not only `[prop]currentColor`.
- Opacity in icons that have transparent elements.

#### Copy icon name

If all you need is icon name to use in your project, for example, for Iconify icon component or for class name in 
UnoCSS or Tailwind CSS, you can now choose format of icon name.

Button to copy icon name to clipboard is next to icon name dropdown.

All changes are stored in browser storage, so you do not need to change settings more than once.

### Designed for the future

The best part about the new rebuild is, new code is fully reusable.

This code base will be used to:
- Update Iconify plugin for Figma.
- Create new plugins for various design and development software.
