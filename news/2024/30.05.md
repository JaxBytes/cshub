## Iconify for React 5.0.0 {#react-500}

The new major version of the Iconify icon component for React has been released.

Changes:
- Rewritten using modern React hooks.
- Works with Next.js (as a client-only component).
- Package uses ES modules by default, though CommonJS is supported too.
- Added `[prop]ssr` property, similar to the recent Vue component update.

See [component documentation](/docs/icon-components/react/index.md).
