## Iconify packages syntax update {#json-import-update}

Iconify packages `[npm]@iconify-json/*` use JSON files to store data.

Until today, JSON files were imported with older `[prop]assert` syntax:

```js
import icons from './icons.json' assert { type: 'json' };
```

Now all packages use new `[prop]with` syntax:

```js
import icons from './icons.json' with { type: 'json' };
```

All runtimes support the new syntax. For Node.js you need version 18 or newer.

If you are using Node version 16 or an older version, consider updating. Old import syntax has been deprecated by Node
and will be removed, so using old syntax is not an option.
