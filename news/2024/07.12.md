## New versions of Iconify icon components, utils and tools {#components-update-dec}

Published new minor versions of the following packages:

- [Iconify Utils](/docs/libraries/utils/index.md).
- [Iconify Tools](/docs/libraries/tools/index.md).
- [Iconify Icon web component](/docs/iconify-icon/index.md) and its wrappers.
- Iconify Icon components for [Vue](/docs/icon-components/vue/index.md), [React](/docs/icon-components/react/index.md) and [Svelte](/docs/icon-components/svelte/index.md).
- [Iconify plugin for Tailwind CSS](/docs/usage/css/tailwind/index.md).

There are 2 changes:

- Icon naming requirements
- Custom icon loaders

### Naming convention changes

The biggest change is in naming convention.

Until now, all components allowed only icon names that contained lower case letters, numbers and dash: `[a-z0-9-]`.

Now those restrictions are removed. Any non-empty string is allowed.

### Custom loaders

Icon components now support custom icon loaders, which you can define using one of these functions:

- `[func]setCustomIconLoader()`.
- `[func]setCustomIconsLoader()`.

What is it for?

- To load icons from custom sources instead of Iconify API.
- To customise icons.

It is currently used by new Nuxt Icon component to load custom icons in Nuxt apps.

See [Iconify Icon component documentation](/docs/iconify-icon/custom-loaders.md).
