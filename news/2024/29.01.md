## Iconify Icon 2.0.0-beta.1 {#icon-200b1}

Iconify Icon web component version 2.0.0 beta 1 has been published.

This release offers massive improvements in SVG performance: it uses `[type]IntersectionObserver` to check
if icon is visible to the current visitor, rendering icon only when visible.

As a nice side effect, icons that have fade in animation start animating when it appears in viewport.

New version is used on this website and new [Iconify icon sets website](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/).

To install beta version, use `[npm]@next` tag:

```bash
npm install --save iconify-icon@next
```

### New "observe" property {#icon-200b1-observe}

You can change observer behavior by changing `[prop]observe` attribute.

By default, it is enabled. To disable it, set `[prop]observe` to `[str]false`.

```html
<iconify-icon icon="mdi:home" observe="false"></iconify-icon>
```

In an instance of `[type]IconifyIconHTMLElementClass` you can use `[prop]observe` property to set/get boolean value.
