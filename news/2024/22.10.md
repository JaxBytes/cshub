## Figma plugin preview {#figma-preview2-ready}

Iconify plugin for Figma has been redesigned.

However, it is not live yet. More testing is needed.

You can [download and install plugin from GitHub repository](https://github.com/iconify/iconify-figma).

Additionally, the previous version of plugin has been backed up in [archive/v3-dist](https://github.com/iconify/iconify-figma/tree/archive/v3-dist)
branch of repository, so you can use the old version after the new version goes live.

See [plugin redesign page for more details and screenshots](/docs/design/figma/update-2024-attempt2.md).
