## New logo {#rebrand}

Old logo was a temporary solution. It was supposed to be replaced with a proper unique logo long time ago, but due
to time constraints and lack of imagination (creating unique logos is VERY hard!), it took several years to come
up with a new logo.

New logo is finally ready.

Over the years Iconify project have become a home for open source icons.
Many developers and designers use Iconify daily in their workflow to find the best open source icons.

New logo represents a home icon, rendered as separate lines.
