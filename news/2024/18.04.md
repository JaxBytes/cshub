## Figma plugin preview {#figma-preview}

Preview of the new Iconify plugin for Figma is available!

This is a complete rewrite, built with Vue.

Short list of new features:
- More compact UI, making it easier to use plugin on small screen.
- Advanced filters for icon sets, favorite icon sets, detailed license information.
- List of icons is now scrollable. You are no longer required to use pagination.
- More precise drag and drop.
- Better handling for icon dimensions. When replacing icon, new icon will be imported with same dimensions. New icons will be imported as small icons.
- Better handling of animated icons. Figma does not support animations, so animations are stripped correctly before importing icon.

You can [download and install plugin from GitHub repository](https://github.com/iconify/iconify-figma).
