## Customise icon stroke width and remove animations {#icon-sets-stroke}

[Iconify icon sets](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/) website has been updated.

You can now:
- Change stroke width in icons that use stroke.
- Remove animations from animated SVGs.

Removing animations from SVGs is very helpful if you want to use icons in design tools.
Currently, all design tools do not support animated SVGs, importing animated icon usually results in broken or empty icon.

By removing animation for design tool, you can use static icon in your design, but animated icon in HTML.
