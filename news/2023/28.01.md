## Custom CSS in the Iconify Icon web component {#iconify-icon-css}

Iconify Icon web component has been updated.

New version includes function to append custom CSS to icons: `[func]appendCustomStyle()`.

Function can be imported from:

-   `[npm]iconify-icon` package.
-   As static method from web component constructor.
-   As method from any `[tag]iconify-icon` element instance.

There are several limitations:

-   It affects all instances of `[tag]iconify-icon` rendered after function is called.
-   It does not affect instances created before function call.
-   You cannot add CSS only for one icon yet.

These limitations will be removed in future versions.

### Example

```js
import { appendCustomStyle } from 'iconify-icon';

appendCustomStyle('svg [stroke-width="2"] { stroke-width: 1.5; }');
```

This will change `[prop]stroke-width` from `[num]2` to `[num]1.5` in all icons, rendered after that function call.
