## Iconify Tools version 4.0.0 {#tools-4}

Iconify Tools version 4.0.0 has been released.

This is a breaking change, see below.

### Changes

What has changed?
- Parallel fetching for importing icons from Figma. This is a massive improvement, can reduce import time by 5 times!
- Built in fetch was replaced with axios, which is faster, and you can configure proxy server.
- Resolved problem of huge call stack when working with large icons. This required a breaking change, see below.

### Breaking changes

Some functions used to be asynchronous, when it was unnecessary.

To allow using Iconify Tools in synchronous environments, such as configuration files for Tailwind CSS plugins,
one of the previous versions of Iconify Tools introduced synchronous variations of async functions.
This has caused issues with big call stack when working with huge icons (500kb+ icons... yes, they exist...).

Version 4.0.0 makes the following functions synchronous only:
- `[func]validateColors()` - checks palette in SVG (used to check colors in icon).
- `[func]parseColors()` - parses palette in SVG (used to change colors).
- `[func]parseSVGStyle()` - finds inline style in SVG, parses it, calls callback for each entry. Very basic parser, cannot handle advanced CSS.
- `[func]cleanupGlobalStyle()` - finds `[tag]<style>` in icon, applies it to elements. Very basic parser, cannot handle advanced CSS.
- `[func]parseSVG()` - parses SVG, calls a callback for each element. This is used internally by many functions that parse icon.
- `[func]deOptimisePaths()` - removes some path optimisations that are not supported by old software.

The following functions were removed as they are no longer needed:
- `[func]validateColorsSync()` - use `[func]validateColors()`.
- `[func]parseColorsSync()` - use `[func]parseColors()`.
- `[func]parseSVGStyleSync()` - use `[func]parseSVGStyle()`.
- `[func]parseSVGSync()` - use `[func]parseSVG()`.

### Cheerio types

Old version used to rely on `[npm]@types/cheerio`. This version uses `[npm]cheerio`'s built in typescript files.

This is a breaking change because if you are using `[npm]@types/cheerio` in your project, you might run into TypeScript 
errors when using Iconify Tools. Solution is not to use `[npm]@types/cheerio`, recent versions of `[npm]cheerio`
provide types.

### New entries

New properties:
- `[prop]axiosConfig` - property to configure axios. Import it from `[file]@iconify/tools/lib/download/api`, value contains options for axios calls, so, for example, to configure proxy set `[prop]proxy` property.

New methods in classes:
- `[prop]toPrettyString()` method in `[type]SVG` instance. It generates formatted string.
