## New icon sets website preview {#icon-sets-preview}

Early preview of new icon sets website is available at [preview.iconify.design](https://preview.iconify.design/)!

This is a completely new, rebuilt icon sets website, powered by Nuxt.

Early preview supports browsing and searching icons.

Main new features:
- Dynamic scrollable pagination. When browsing icons, the number of icons shown per page depends on your browser window. You can also scroll icons instead of using pagination.
- Advanced filters (click arrow button near filters in the top right corner). You can filter icon sets by grid, license and palette.
- Icon customisations. You can change colors, opacity of elements that have opacity, icon size. More options will be available later.
- Better code samples. While the old version focused on usage with Iconify icon components, the new version's main focus other methods of using icons: SVG, CSS. Code for icon components will be available too.

### What is the purpose?

Rewrite's main purpose is to create reusable code base.

The same code base can be later used to create various plugins for design software, web platforms and applications.

### State

Currently, this is just a preview.

This is not a full Nuxt app yet, all components are currently client side only.
