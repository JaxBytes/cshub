## Support for require-trusted-types-for script policy {#require-trusted-types-for}

Several icon components have been updated:
- Iconify Icon web component
- SVG framework
- Iconify for React

New versions of packages work in environments with strict content security policy `[str]require-trusted-types-for 'script';`.

Iconify icon components rely on `[prop]innerHTML` to render SVG instead of doing unnecessary complex parsing of HTML.

But it is not needed. All icons in Iconify ecosystem pass very strict validation.
Icons that contain scripts, event listeners, external resources, raster images and fonts are not allowed.
All unknown tags and attributes are removed.

### About require-trusted-types-for security policy

Security policy mentioned above requires libraries to clean up HTML before assigning it to `[prop]innerHTML` property of a DOM element.

To add that policy to your document, all you have to do is add the following code to page header:

```html
<meta
  http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
  content="require-trusted-types-for 'script';"
/>
```

However, be aware that policy does not provide any actual security and is pretty much useless!

The process of cleaning up HTML is not regulated in any way, it is up to a library to decide how to clean up HTML.  
This means libraries can just emulate clean up without doing any actual clean up. 

Your website security should not rely on such useless "security" policies.
