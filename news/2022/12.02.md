Huge thanks to [Around](https://around.co/?utm_source=iconify&utm_medium=partnership) for sponsoring Iconify plugin for Figma!

Around is an excellent collaboration tool designed for developers. [Check them out](https://around.co/?utm_source=iconify&utm_medium=partnership)!.

Working on Iconify is a full time job, and servers cost money, while open source development does not pay, so sponsorships are very welcome. Thanks to Around for reaching out and offering to help out.

You can contribute too! If you are using Iconify in your projects, please [consider supporting Iconify](/sponsors/index.md).
